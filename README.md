# High-Level Clouds Prediction
This study considers the possibility of detecting high-level clouds HLCs using machine learning methods based on the meteorological observations, ERA5 reanalysis and atmospheric lidar sensing data. 

### Data

The presence of HLCs over Tomsk, derived from standard meteorological observations (every 3 hours) at the Tomsk hydrometeorological station (No. 29430), is used as the target variable.

***Data Source:***  
[Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information – World Data Centre (RIHMI–WDC).](http://meteo.ru) Target variable (Available online).
