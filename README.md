# High-Level Clouds Prediction
This study considers the possibility of detecting high-level clouds using machine learning methods based on the atmospheric lidar sensing, meteorological observations, and ERA5 reanalysis data. 



### Data

The presence of HLCs over Tomsk, derived from standard meteorological observations (every 3 hours) at the Tomsk hydrometeorological station (No. 29430), is used as the target variable.
